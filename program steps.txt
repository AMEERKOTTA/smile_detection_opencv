AUTO CAPTURE SELFY BY DETECTING SMILE
=====================================

This is a Simple Machine Learning Project Using OpenCV

OpenCV
======

+ OpenCV is an open-source library for computer vision with a focus of real time 
  Applications

+ OpenCV mainly focus on VideoCapturing, VideoProcessing, Image Processing and 
  analysis.

+ OpenCV has many built in functions

Steps for Projects
==================

Download "haarcascade xml" files

+ haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml
+ haarcascade_smile.xml

Save those in particular folders.

haar Cascade:
=============
It is Machine Learning Object Detection Algorithm used to identify objects in
an image or video.

Algorithm Steps
===============

1. Haar Feature Selection
2. Creating Integral Image 
3. Adaboost Training 
4. Cascading Classifiers

# **smile_detection_opencv**
Model that Capture Images by Detecting Smile in the Face.

**OpenCV**
+ This is a Simple Machine Learning Project Using OpenCV
+ OpenCV is an open-source library for computer vision with a focus of real time 
  Applications
+ OpenCV mainly focus on VideoCapturing, VideoProcessing, Image Processing and 
  analysis.

**Steps for Projects**
+ Download "haarcascade xml" files
  + haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml
  + haarcascade_smile.xml
  
**haar Cascade:**
It is Machine Learning Object Detection Algorithm used to identify objects in
an image or video.

1. Haar Feature Selection
2. Creating Integral Image
3. Adaboost Training
4. Cascading Classifiers
